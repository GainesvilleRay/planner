Swift Nature Camp: Swift Nature Camp is an overnight nature camp for boys and girls ages 6-15. Our focus is to blend traditional summer camp activities while increasing a child's appreciation for nature, science and the environment.

Our special Discovery Camp is a nurturing program for first-time overnight campers, offering additional staff to provide support and encouragement to overcome homesickness and build confidence. The program welcomes no more than 50 first-time campers, and the special attention that this intimate group receives is the reason that more than 92% of them wish to return.

Swift Nature Camp offers traditional summer camp activities along with an environmental focus. Campers enjoy an active Nature Center, Pet Zoo, and Department of Natural Resources sponsored programs, plus recreational activities that include canoe and backpack trips, horseback riding, swimming, arts & crafts, team courses, archery, sailing, water skiing, tubing and sports.

In addition to these traditional activities, Swift Nature Camp is so much more. We are a child-centered program located away from technology, celebrity culture and academic pressures. Through fun activities and positive staff role models, we help children develop lifelong skills such as confidence, teamwork, leadership, compassion and communication. Our small size allows us to promote each child's personal development by providing fun, friendship and leadership in a supportive and noncompetitive environment. While away from home, children will have the opportunity to act on their own, become self-reliant, and try things for themselves.

Many of our kids return year after year saying that "Swift allows me to be my real self with real people." And we feel that's a good thing!

All of this happens in the fun and sun of the north woods of Wisconsin. For staff and campers alike, Swift Nature Camp is more than just a place to be: it is their summer home. So why not have your child join our summer camp family this summer?
